I. INTRODUCTION
As a carrier of resources and communication,
information is universal, sharing, value-added, rational and
multi-effect, which is of special significance to the
development of human society. Information security is a
problem that must be paid attention by any country,
government, sector and industry. It is a national security
strategy that cannot be ignored. One of the main attributes of
information security is confidentiality. Cryptography studies
how to transform information in a hidden way and prevent
others from getting it.
As a high-level programming language, Python has
become a popular language in the field of programming
with its simplicity, readability and extensibility, and has
become the first choice for data scientists. The Python
language provides a large number of built-in data structures
and functions that are very convenient for data science
programs[1]. With the development of the Internet and the
presentation of big data, the security of data is becoming
more and more difficult to guarantee, and the value of data
is gradually increasing. In recent years, a variety of
encryption algorithms have been proposed[2-6], in which
the encryption algorithm of image and video encryption
algorithm have been applied in many practical
applications[7-17]. This paper combines Python language
technology and encryption algorithm to study the encryption
algorithm based on Python, focusing on the characteristics
and scope of each algorithm based on Python.
II. RESEARCH OF ENCRYPTION
A. Caesar Cipher
Caesar cipher uses keys to encrypt messages in different
ways depending on the key. The keys of the Caesar cipher
are integers from 0 to 25. Even if Caesar cipher is used in
advance, there is not enough information to decipher the
password. The key is the must. In cryptography, the Caesar
cipher is the simplest and most widely known encryption
technique. It is a replacement for encryption, and all letters in
the plaintext are replaced by a fixed number of letters
backwards (or forwards) on the alphabet. For example, when
the offset is 5, all the letters A will be replaced by F, B
becomes G, and so on. The Caesar cipher is usually used as a
step in other more complex encryption methods. The Caesar
cipher is also used in the modern ROT13 system. But like all
encryption technologies that use the alphabet to replace, the
Caesar cipher is very easy to be cracked, and it cannot
guarantee communication security in practical applications
or maintain the integrity of the specifications
The template is used to format paper and style the text.
All margins, column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are
prescribed; please do not alter them. The peculiarities are
noted. For example, the head margin in this template is
measured proportionately unlike by the customary. This
measurement and others are deliberate, using specifications
that anticipate your paper as one part of the entire
proceedings, and not as an independent document. Please do
not revise any of the current designations.
B. Simple Substitution ciper
The simple substitution cipher, also known as
monoalphabetic cipher. A character in a plaintext is replaced
by a corresponding ciphertext character, and the characters
used in the ciphertext and the characters used in the general
plaintext belong to the same language system. The simple
substitution cipher can effectively resist violent deciphering.
Even if a computer can test 106 keys per second, it will take
12 million years to test each key.
C. Vigenere Cipher
People expand the multiple table ciphers on the basis of
the Caesar cipher, it is called the Vigenere cipher. The
Vigenere cipher is similar to the Caesar cipher, except for the
use of multiple keys. Because it uses more than one set of

substitutions, it is also called a polyalphabetic substitution
cipher. In the Vigenere cipher, the sender and the recipient
must use the same keyword or the same text section, it is the
key. The key word or the letter in word section tells them
how to change the location of the letter before and after to
get the correct corresponding position of each letter in the
paragraph.
III. EXPERIMENTAL ENVIRONMENT AND EXPERIMENTAL
METHOD
The experimental environment information is shown in
Table 1. The experiment is divided into two groups. One
tests the same ciphertext, and another one tests the different
ciphertext. The test was done eight times.

The same ciphertext message is “This is my secret
message!” the second encrypted message is “This is my
secret message! This is my secret message!” and so on.
The different ciphertext message is “I am happy to join
with you today in what will go down in history as the
greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our
nation. Five score years ago, a great American, in whose
symbolic shadow we stand today”. The first experiment
selected the first 22 characters, the second experiment
selected the first 44 characters, and so on.
Track the encrypted run time using Python code
statements and record all test run times.

In this experiment condition, as can be seen from Figure
1, when encrypting the same ciphertext, the Caesar Cipher
takes less time than the Simple Substitution Cipher and the
Vigenere Cipher. The Simple Substitution Cipher is similar
to the time used by the Vigenere Cipher. As can be seen
from Figure 2, the time used by Caesar Cipher and the
Simple Substitution Cipher increases with the number of
ciphertext. But the time used by the Vigenere Cipher is more
stable. This result is related to the principle of each
encryption algorithm.
The experimental results show that the length of time
spent on encryption is related to the content of encryption.
And encrypting different content takes less time than
encrypting the same content ciphertext.
V. CONCLUSIONS
Through the principle of each encryption algorithms and
related experiments. Comparison of three encryption
algorithms, as shown in Table 2.

To sum up, the time used to encrypt the same ciphertext
and the different ciphertext are different. When encrypting
the same ciphertext, the Caesar Cipher takes less time than
the Simple Substitution Cipher and the Vigenere Cipher.
When encrypting the different ciphertext, the time used by
Caesar Cipher and the Simple Substitution Cipher increases
with the number of ciphertext. The time used by the
Vigenere Cipher is more stable.
The implementation of Caesar Cipher is simple and the
operation time is short, but its security is low. It is suitable
for encrypting non-important documents. The Simple
Substitution Cipher runs for a long time, difficult to realize,

but with high security. It is suitable for encrypting ordinary
documents. However, the Vigenere Cipher runs for a short
time, easy to realize, and with high security. It is suitable for
encrypting important documents. In addition, Python is easy
to implement data encryption and operate, which will play a
greater role in future research of encryption algorithms.
